# What do we want to build?

There are many AOSP projects, you can decide building. 

A few more popular are

1. [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/)
2. [ArrowOS](https://arrowos.net/)
3. [crDroid](https://crdroid.net/)
4. [PixelExperience (+)](https://get.pixelexperience.org/)

 If you have decided on what to build, we are going to sync the project. 
 ##### I will show examples for the ROM crDroid.
